# Tweet-Spammer
spamming. The presence of spam on web services such as search engines, email providers or online networking services can be manifested in many ways including spam advertising, malicious links, fake news or fake friends but also manipulation attempts. For online social network, tracking and controlling spammers are of the upmost importance due to the security risk but also for the credibility of the information that they disseminate. The objective of this project is to study Twitterâ€™s social spam by means of both data mining, machine learning and data analysis techniques (that you have learned so far in any course!) using a dataset containing information on 767 social spammers and legitimate users crawled from Twitter in November and December 2014 and July 2018. In this project you have firstly to solve the spam detection problem and secondly to analyse the dataset using methods presented during the lessons of data mining.
